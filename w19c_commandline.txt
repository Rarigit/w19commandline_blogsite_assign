Now that we can connect our python application to our DB, let's go ahead and create a strange application! This application will allow users to create blog posts from their terminal and see posts as well!

 

REMEMBER TO COMMENT YOUR CODE
REMEMBER TO CREATE YOUR .GITIGNORE

 

Create a new Git/GitHub repository

Create the following local DB schema:

client
id (PK)
username (unique)
joined_on
password
post
id(PK)
client_id (FK)
content
title
INSERT at least 3 clients and 5 posts

Once you have the DB created you can start the python application:

Before you start coding, make sure your debugger, venv and .gitignore are all in place already
Create an app.py file that achieves the following:
Create a function that will:
Ask the user for their username and password
Check with the DB a user with that username / password combo exist.
This is a procedure that contains a select query!
Return the id of the client if they do exist
Return None (python's version of undefined) if they do not exist
Create a function that will:
Accept a client id as an argument
Prompt the user to type a title and content for a post
Put that new post into the DB
This is a procedure that contains an insert query!
Create a function that will:
Retrieve all posts from the DB
Print out each post's title and content to the console
Create a function that will:
Attempt to log the user in
Loop infinitely

Ask the user if they would like to insert a new post, 
read all posts or quit (select 1, 2 or 3)

Call the correct function based on their choice
Call the function that kicks off the loop
 

Take a full backup of the DB

Add, commit and push your code. REMEMBER NOT TO ADD THE credentials FILE!

HINTS:

If a user with a specific username and password exist, the length of the list sent back
from the select procedure will be 1, otherwise will be 0
Break the assignment into 3 parts, making the DB, coding the procedures and coding the python
BONUS:

Give the user an option to see only posts made by them
Give an option that will show all the usernames in the system
Give the user an option to only see posts made by a user of their choice
